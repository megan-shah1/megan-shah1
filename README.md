- 🤔 I'm interested in full-stack development and would love to work in software engineering/development, machine learning, or cybersecurity.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning more about web development and data structures.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on research or personal projects to expand my computer science knowledge to make a difference!
